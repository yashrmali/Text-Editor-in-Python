# Text-Editor-in-Python
Hello friends, Here, I am presenting you with text editor in python.
      The text editor software is used to edit plain text or text files.
      A notepad is a text-only editor that only works with .txt files but can still read and edit file formats that can be edited. This project is a very simple one to         make, but you are still going to have a lot of fun creating it.
